For this project I wanted to make sound and visuals that low fidelity; I built the song myself with a analog synthesizer/Eurorack emulator on my computer with which I recorded a longer jam session and then pieced the sound together into a semi-drone like composition. I then bit crushed and re-exported it several times to give it more of a crunch. Visually I wanted to emulate the component arrangement of an analog synth rack, with components slotting in to the physical space allowed by other components. Additionally, I wanted to have a very digital look that represented the bit crushed lo-fi sound, so I focused on working with just rough shapes constructed from squares. 

The fft analysis proved a little more difficult to get subtlety out of the visuals, but I was pretty happy of the way in which the different components act as pseudo sequencer visualizers and represent some of the higher frequency fft bands.

The main compositional logic is dictated by the positioning of the bouncing particle cloud, with the rest of the components slotting in depending on its position vertically and whether it is left or right aligned.
